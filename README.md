## 🚀 About Me

I'm Janine – an **AWS Certified DevOps Engineer**, **Graphic Designer**, and **Full-Stack Web & Software Developer** based in the wonderful city of **Warsaw, Poland**.

I'm passionate about:
- Building strong, automated systems  
- Designing beautiful user experiences  
- And occasionally screaming at my terminal when Docker refuses to obey 

But wait, there's more!

I'm also a **Twitch Bot & Extension Developer**, injecting interactive chaos and live fun into streamers worlds. Whether that's custom overlays, viewer-triggered madness or sneaky little Easter eggs – I love making Twitch a bit more fun (and a lot more wild & chaotic 😎).

And of course: **AI enthusiast at heart**.  
When I'm not fighting cloud infrastructure or perfecting UIs, I'm exploring AI model families **locally** using **[Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer)** – because sometimes, you just want to talk to a language model that lives *right next to your keyboard*.

## 🧰 Tech Stack – *a.k.a. my digital playground*

| 🧩 Expertise            | 🚀 Tools & Tech |
|----------------------|----------------|
| **☁️ Cloud & DevOps**     | `AWS`, `Docker`, `Kubernetes`, `Terraform`, `CI/CD` (GitHub Actions, Jenkins) – if it can be automated, I’m on it. |
| **💻 Languages**          | `C#`, `JavaScript`, `TypeScript`, `PHP`, `Python`, `Java`, `Swift` – fluent in code and sarcasm. |
| **⚙️ Frameworks & Libs**  | `Node.js`, `React`, `Laravel`, `NativeScript`, `Expo` – modern tools for building modern magic. |
| **🗃️ Databases**          | `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `MongoDB` – because data deserves a cozy, structured home. |
| **🎨 Design & UX**        | `Figma`, `Adobe Creative Suite`, `ProCreate` – because even error messages deserve to look good. |
| **📺 Streaming Tech**     | `Twitch API`, `Twitch Extension SDK`, `WebSockets` – making live content more alive. |

## 🧠 AI & Pinokio – *Because local is the new cloud*

I develop and explore **AI model families locally** with [**Pinokio**](https://pinokio.computer), running them right on my machine like a digital science lab.

No need to ship everything off to the cloud –  
sometimes the real magic happens right here,  
next to my **coffee mug**, **three open terminals** and a suspiciously blinking LED.

> (*It's like having your own little AI zoo – but with fewer goats and more JSON.*)
